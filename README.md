## Description

This site takes a positive integer from a user and returns a list of all whole numbers up to and including that integer; it replaces all multiples of 3 with 'ping', all multiples of 5 with 'pong', and all multiples of 15 with 'pingpong'.

Alternately, the user can choose to:
1. Play PingPong
2. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of prime numbers below a chosen integer
3. Convert an arabic number into its Roman equivalent

## Known Bugs

If input begins with an integer, it will accept it even if later characters are not numbers.
